# Bolmo

Bolmo is a platform for finding rental housing and roommates, designed around real human scenarios rather than simple property listings.

The project addresses common problems of the rental market: low trust, fragmented platforms, fake listings, and the lack of tools for finding compatible people for shared living.

## What Bolmo Is About

Bolmo brings together three core use cases in a single product:

1. Finding rental housing  
2. Finding a roommate when housing is not yet available  
3. Finding a roommate for an existing home  

Unlike traditional real estate platforms, Bolmo focuses not only on apartments and rooms, but also on **people**, their lifestyles, preferences, and compatibility.

## Problems Bolmo Solves

- Difficulty finding a reliable roommate or co-tenant  
- Fake listings and excessive intermediaries  
- Poor filtering for real-life living scenarios  
- Lack of trust between landlords, tenants, and roommates  
- Rental and roommate searches scattered across multiple platforms  

Bolmo is built to simplify decision-making and reduce stress in the housing search process.

## Core Idea

Housing is not just about location and price — it is about people.

Bolmo treats roommate search as a social and lifestyle matching problem, combining housing details with personal preferences, habits, and expectations. This helps users find not just a place to live, but a living arrangement that actually works.

## Trust and Safety

Trust is a central pillar of Bolmo.

The platform emphasizes:
- verified user profiles
- reduced exposure to fake accounts
- transparent user information
- moderation focused on quality, not quantity

This approach increases confidence and improves the quality of interactions between users.

## Vision

Bolmo aims to become a single, trusted entry point for:
- renting housing
- sharing living spaces
- finding compatible people to live with

The long-term goal is to create a safer, more human-centered rental experience, where users feel confident about who they live with and where they live.

## Project Status

Bolmo is an early-stage product under active development.  
The concept, flows, and positioning may evolve as the platform grows.
